# Eye Diseases Classification using DenseNet-161

## 📌 What are you making?
This project aims to build an image classification model to detect and classify **four types of eye diseases** from retinal images:
- **Cataract**
- **Diabetic Retinopathy**
- **Glaucoma**
- **Normal**

The purpose of this project is to assist in early detection and diagnosis of eye diseases using deep learning and computer vision.

## 🏗️ What architecture you use?
The model is based on **DenseNet-161**, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The final classification layer has been replaced with a custom `nn.Linear` layer to fit the 4-class classification task.

## 🧪 What library you use?
This project is implemented using the following libraries:
- `PyTorch`
- `Torchvision`
- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `tqdm`
- `TensorBoard`
- `os`, `shutil`, `random`, and other Python standard libraries

## 🛠️ How to run your model

### 1. Prepare the Dataset
Download and unzip the dataset into the following structure:
```
/dataset/
├── Cataract/
├── Diabetic Retinopathy/
├── Glaucoma/
└── Normal/
```

### 2. Split Dataset (Train/Validation)
```python
# Split 90% training and 10% validation using shutil and os modules
```

### 3. Data Preprocessing
```python
# Resize images to 224x224
# Normalize using ImageNet statistics
# Use torchvision.transforms.Compose for train and val sets
```

### 4. Model Setup
```python
# Load DenseNet161 from torchvision.models
# Replace classifier with nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 4)
```

### 5. Training
```python
# Use SGD optimizer with lr=0.0005 and momentum=0.9
# Scheduler: StepLR with step_size=6, gamma=0.1
# Loss function: CrossEntropyLoss
# Epochs: 20
```

### 6. Evaluation
```python
# Evaluate on validation data using accuracy metrics
# Visualize predictions and confusion matrix
```
